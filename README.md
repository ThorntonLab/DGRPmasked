#Masked regions in DGRP lines identified in Cridland et al. (2013) doi: 10.1093/molbev/mst129

The format of the file is a simple tab-delimited table with 4 columns: chromosome, left_pos, right_pos, line1, line2. Each line represents a region defined by the interval from left_pos to right_pos on chromosome for which line1 and line2 are very similar in their SNP calls (based on the DGRP FASTA files). See the manuscript linked above for details. This table results in Figure 1 in the manuscript.
